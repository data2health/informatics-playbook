# Chapter 6: Clinical Data Harmonization

## Purpose & Intended audience

This resource offers guidance to members of the CTSA informatics community including information about Data Harmonization that key stakeholders (leadership, researchers, clinicians, CIOs) can use at their institutions. This guidance can be useful to those who are new to Data Harmonization, as well as to those who are experts and may need assistance conveying the importance of Data Harmonization to a lay audience.

## Why is this important?

Clinical data are among the most valuable artifacts within CTSA hubs. Appropriately leveraging these data for translational research purposes, while respecting privacy and honoring hub autonomy, will advance CTSA goals and demonstrate its power as a network. The Health Level 7 (HL7) FHIR standard has the potential to enable hubs to develop a next-generation repository from application program interfaces (APIs) that are built into every electronic health record (EHR). For optimal harmonization, these APIs need to be integration-ready, whether used directly for federated queries or for transformation to any number of common standards.
