# Chapter 4: Managing Translational Informatics Projects

## Intended audience
Managers of Translational Informatics Projects

## Why is this important
Translational Informatics projects are increasingly cross-institutional and even international; however, managing them comes with many shared pain points. This guidance will help anyone who is organizing or managing cross-functional distributed teams that develop code or that analyze data across the translational divide. Specifically, we will introduce several practical tools and techniques for managers to facilitate these kinds of endeavors. Exercises in the companion tutorial will familiarize participants with helpful tools and techniques, and help them make informed decisions about which tools might work best for their particular contexts. We conclude with a session wherein all participants are welcome to share additional pain points and related experience.
