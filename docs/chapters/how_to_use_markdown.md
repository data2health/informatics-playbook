# Images
You can add images as you like but each image will take a row of each own.

***Example***
  
![image text](../_static/dhFPtgZkNPu1CyeC_CkPCHbfWrKblUt0mWqaeHzkO2DSc1oUwxRffwz2HJEleNcxbrO2lSSAPA6AJHHjKlcRksYQ3ap4jPfp6wN1elE-NbS2mMgIFo6eNRORILy6rmAc1-ybjD2gB1qYD3ra8g.jpg)   
  
![image text](../_static/raN-MMDEcVjGod-OO2_KODj9P-I_7_nr9Qwrzbjmch6i3qpRgEsReBk3GtRGJs8UDiaTbodZynnXnERPYgv0d1aQ6JefHGk5OZ8zv1_Z1DqGs14M8bJ3-gP54Ejy5mE-luU1RQClyLOlYsYmwQ.jpg)   
  
  
  
  
# Bookmarks
Bookmarks within the document are also available. To bookmark your text add a link pointing to the corresponding element you want to bookmark. Look at the example below.

***Example***
  
[Link to things to look for](#link-to-things-to-look-for)  
[Pro-tips](#pro-tips)  
  
===============  
**Footnotes:** [1](#kix.yqiegj2x8ffu)Footnotes are also available. All footnotes will be gathered and added at the bottom of the document under a “References” header. Footnote numbers will be automatically converted to links that point to the corresponding footnote.
To manually add a citation to a footnote in markdown first create a "References" header at the bottom of the chapter. Add there all the footnotes you want. Then add your citation in the text. To link a citation and a footnote together add the same link to the start of each line (both the citation and the footnote).
The footnote link can be empty to not display anything. To see how it's done look at the citation at the start of this paragraph and the footnote at the end of the chapter below the "References" header.
  
  
# Tables

Tables are also supported. 1st row will be bolded, use this to explain what your data is in each column.

***Example***

|1 |2 |3 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
|4 |5 |6 |

## Things to look for:
  
- Try not to mix “Emphasis” or “Link” elements with other elements such as headers and titles because it might add additional unwanted new lines.
- Try not to add too much formatting in your “Heading” elements like bolds, italics etc. Also try not to extend these to multiple lines.
- Images will span full width of the document.
- Direct videos are not available, but you can paste a youtube link and it will be embedded in the final result automatically.
- Don’t use “Heading” elements for anything other than headers. Each heading will be added to the table of contents so long text should be avoided.
- Tables inside cells are not supported
